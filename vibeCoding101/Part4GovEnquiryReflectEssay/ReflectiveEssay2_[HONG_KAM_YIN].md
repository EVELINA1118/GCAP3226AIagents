## Reflective Essay

Drafting a formal enquiry for flu vaccination data reshaped how I understand Hong Kong’s data governance. I learned that data.gov.hk offers broad statistics, but district-level, program, and cost data usually require a Code on Access to Information request and careful justification.

The writing process forced specificity: naming fields (e.g., vaccination rates by age/district, school consent rates, ICU occupancy), formats (CSV/Excel), and time windows (2019–2024). I also had to acknowledge privacy limits and propose aggregated, anonymised outputs. The AI agent helped structure the letter, tighten tone, and check completeness, while the earlier chatbot tutor was better for exploring policy context and trade-offs. Together, they pushed me to be precise and realistic about what government can release and within what timelines.

This exercise strengthened my project plan. If the request is denied or delayed, I will pivot to open datasets, HA reports, and a small survey to triangulate insights. More importantly, I now see data access as a professional skill: clear scoping, respectful communication, and contingency planning—all essential for evidence-based policymaking beyond this course.
