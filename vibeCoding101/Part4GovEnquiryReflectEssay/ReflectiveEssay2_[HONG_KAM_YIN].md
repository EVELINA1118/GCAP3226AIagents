## Reflective Essay

Participating in Team 3's typhoon preparedness project gave me a deeper understanding of the challenges in Hong Kong's government data governance, especially during extreme weather events. From drafting enquiries to the Hong Kong Observatory about signal decision-making, to analyzing historical typhoon data, I realized that while much data is public, the most critical decision criteria—such as real-time wind speed, timing, and interdepartmental coordination—often require formal requests and may not be fully disclosed.

Writing the government enquiry taught me to specify exactly what data fields I needed (signal issuance time, wind speed at each station, casualty and damage reports) and to reference the Code on Access to Information for a professional and respectful request. The AI agent helped me refine the letter's structure, tone, and completeness, but the real judgment about data needs came from applying course concepts like regression and simulation, and discussing with my team. This collaboration made me think more critically about the data foundations and risk trade-offs behind government decisions.

This experience strengthened my data literacy and showed me the importance of contingency planning in policy analysis: if requests are denied or data is incomplete, I can supplement with open datasets, news reports, and simulation analysis. In the future, combining data enquiry, AI collaboration, and critical reflection will be essential for my work in public policy and crisis management.
